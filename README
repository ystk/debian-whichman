This package holds THREE little search utilities.

-------------------------------------------------------------
whichman -- search utility for man pages and it works
            much like the well known unix command "where".

It shows the the location of a given man-page by looking at
your MANPATH environment variable. whichman is especially
useful if you have forgotten the precise name of a
man-page/command since it performs case in-senstitive
approximate pattern searches. It does this be computing
the Levenshtein Distance between the search pattern and
the man-page name.

Here is a demonstration on how whichman compensates typing errors
or forgotten command names:
> whichman erep
/usr/man/man1/grep.1
/usr/man/man1/egrep.1

> whichman netwhat
/usr/man/man8/netstat.8

> whichman print
/usr/man/man1/printf.1.gz
/usr/man/man3/printf.3.gz
/usr/man/man3/rint.3.gz

... or to see in what sections a command is available:
> whichman -0 exit
/usr/man/man2/exit.2
/usr/man/man3/exit.3
/usr/man/man3/Exit.3
/usr/man/mann/exit.n

 
-------------------------------------------------------------
ftff -- a fault tolerant file finder

ftff works like the whichman above but searches the directory
tree. This is a case in-sensitive and fault tolerant way of
'find . -name xxxx -print'
-------------------------------------------------------------
ftwhich -- a fault tolerant "which" command 

ftwhich finds files (programs) which are in one of the directories in 
your PATH and uses a fault tolerant search algorithem.

Example, search all clocks:
> ftwhich -0 '*clock*'
/usr/X11/bin/xclock
/usr/X11/bin/rclock
/usr/X11/bin/moonclock
/usr/X11/bin/oclock
/usr/X11/bin/xdaliclock
/usr/openwin/bin/clock

-------------------------------------------------------------
Installation:
on most systems (especially Linux) you can just type
make
make install
This installes everything into /usr/...

To install into /usr/local you can run
make  PREFIX=/usr/local install 
instead.

The above method used the install program. To use normal copy 
instead you can run:
make  PREFIX=/usr/local install_with_cp

A spec file to build an rpm-package is also provided.

History of whichman:
version 1.0  -first public release

version 1.1  -approximate stringmatch added
             
version 1.2  -optimisation in the approximate string match
             -ftff added

version 1.3  -whichman bug fix. some.page.1 was before this 
              version read as 'some'
             -show distance values with option -p
             -bug fixes in the ftff.1 man page.
             -option -f for ftff added.
             
version 1.4 -ftff bug fix: ftff /home/ something did produce
1998-04-17   duplicated slashes as e.g /home//xyz/something
            -whichman, language dependent man pages can now
             also be searched.

version 1.5 -ftff and whichman: new option parser
1999-01-29   and new option for case sensitive search.
            -ftwhich added

version 1.6 -better Makefile
1999-05-17  -ftwhich: check if this is an executable file.
            -ftwhich,whichman: better handling of broken path settings

version 1.7 -whichman did seg fault when MANPATH had spaces at the end, fixed
1999-09-16

version 1.8 -doc for ftff updated. Follow symlink and a symlink to ..
2000-04-11   causes naturaly an endless loop
            -option -q to keep ftff quiet when it can not read a directory.
            -option parser changed to accept -- as argumant to stop
             option reading.
            -Now we use option -I instead of -s
version 1.9 -print version in help text
2000-05-10  -whichman: accept manpages compressed with bz2

version 2.0 -calculate standard tolerance level with out 
2001-05-04   taking wildcards into account.

version 2.1 -clean up warnings that you get with modern gcc
2002-10-07   

version 2.2 -updated specfile
2003-01-04   

version 2.3 -updated Makefile
2004-01-19   

version 2.4 -gentoo ebuild file added and Makefile adjusted
2004-04-14
